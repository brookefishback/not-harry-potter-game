# not-harry-potter-game
A simple 'Not Harry Potter' video game

Project requirements:

You have been tasked with building “Not Harry Potter™®©”, a magic duel game that is totally not Harry Potter.
-The hero (NOT Harry Potter!) can choose between at least 3 spells
-The hero (still not Potter) casts a spell that damages their opponent
-The opponent (he-who-can-be-named-as-long-as-his-name-is-not-Voldemort™) then performs a generic attack against not-Potter
-This cycle continues until the health of one player falls below 1 hp, when the victor (NOT Viktor Krum™!) is declared
Hints:
-Loop until battle has completed
-Research “random.rangrange”. This function selects a random number from a range, which is useful for calculating damage
